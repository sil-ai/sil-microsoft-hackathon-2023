# Project 2: AI Agents & Translation for Low Resource Languages

Translating the Bible into low-resource languages (languages without much if any digital text data), is a challenging but crucial task. As powerful as AI language models have become, they still are predominantly trained on majority languages, limiting their applicability in these situations.

However, there may be creative ways to open up new possibilities for AI language models to contribute to this translation work. Hackathon participants will brainstorm, prototype, and test some of these approaches.

For example, hackathon participants could try simulating a Bible translation team who begins with minimal data, but different roles (translator, back-translator, linguist, consultant, etc.). Each AI agent is given a specific task, with prompts and data retrieval tailored for that task.

Alternatively, hackathon participants could explore using a swarm-based or hive-mind approach, where many AI bots are deployed on small, highly specific tasks across an entire translation, iteratively improving the results.

Furthermore, even the least resourced languages may benefit from new quality checking processes powered by AI insights, and always in reference to the Greek and Hebrew source texts.

Hackathon participants will have access to extensive linguistic data in various structured and unstructured formats, covering both the source texts (Greek and Hebrew) and target languages (i.e., partially complete translation projects courtesy of the eBible corpus).

Suggested approaches might include:

* Creating one or more AI agents in an iterative simulation
* Leveraging more conventional probabilistic techniques such as training statistical alignment models.
* Solving out-of-vocabulary problems when an LLM is fed data from a new language that was not in the training data
* Fine-tuning a sequence-to-sequence translation LLM on new data
