    "\n",
    "This short notebook facilitates the quick loading up and slicing of **parallel biblical data**. The data is stored in a CSV file, which is loaded into a **Pandas** dataframe (i.e., a Python-native tabular format). The dataframe can then be sliced to extract the desired data (such as a particular book). \n",

    "This notebook also exemplifies prompting the **OpenAI chat completion** endpoint using **LangChain**, to help get you started prompting **ChatGPT** with biblical data.\n",
